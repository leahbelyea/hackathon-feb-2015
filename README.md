##Project - Should I Go To School?
http://shouldigotoschool.citizenscode.org/

This is a tool for high school students who are looking at post-secondary education to determine whether or not it is worth it for them to pursue a career path that they may be considering.

We look at employment rate statistics, post-graduation salary statistics and student loan statistics to determine the how many years it will take for them to "break even" in money spent/earned when compared to someone working immediately out of high school.
